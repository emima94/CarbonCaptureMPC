% Scenario 1: Reference control on yga, with step changes in reference and in ygina or Fgina. 
% MVs: F, Q
% Objective: phi = (yga_ref - yga)^2 + lambda_F * dF + lambda_Q * dQ
% 
% Scenario 2: EMPC. Varying electricity price and CO2 price. 
% MVs: F, Q
% Objective: phi = electricity_price * Q - CO2_price * Na + lambda_F * dF + lambda_Q * dQ
%
% Solve OCPs with single shooting.
% Import nn_settings and par_star from R to Julia. 
% Make Julia functions to construct the system equations, based on nn_settings and par_star.
